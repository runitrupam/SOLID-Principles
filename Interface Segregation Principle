4. Interface Segregation Principle
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. 
Instead, you should break down large, monolithic interfaces into smaller,
more specific ones so that classes only need to implement the methods relevant to them.

Benefits of ISP:
	1.	Improved Maintainability: Smaller interfaces are easier to understand and modify.
	2.	Better Reusability: Classes can pick and choose which interfaces to implement, improving flexibility.
	3.	Reduced Unnecessary Dependencies: Classes are not burdened with methods they donâ€™t need.

Cons:- 
1.	Overhead in Managing Interfaces: Splitting interfaces adds unnecessary complexity in simple systems.
	2.	Lack of Reusability: Strict separation can lead to duplication of shared functionality.
	3.	Difficult to Extend: Adding new vehicle types may require significant refactoring.
	4.	Increased Boilerplate Code: More interfaces and classes lead to a bloated codebase.
	5.	Over-Specialization: Excessive segregation can make the design rigid and less flexible.
